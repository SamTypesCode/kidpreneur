## <p name="introduction">Introduction</p>

This web application allows students to submit and showcase their startup ideas, emphasizing the problems they aim to solve. All ideas are aggregated and displayed on a single, dynamic page built with Next.js and React, ensuring fast navigation and seamless client-side rendering. Users can filter, sort, and paginate submissions, while the backend powered by TypeScript, Prisma, and a PostgreSQL database (hosted on Neon) ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and security. This setup makes it easy for visitors to explore, learn from, and get inspired by a wide variety of ideas.
